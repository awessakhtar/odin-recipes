    by now we all know that the old piece of burger wisdom "never press on your burger!" is either patently false or, at the very least, wildly inaccurate. Heck, there's an entire successful burger chain devoted to using the technique. <br>
    While a more traditional griddled burger might be cooked with the goal of a loose, tender texture in mind, a smash burger goes for one thing only: maximum crust.

    <p>See, by placing a ball of meat on a hot, unoiled griddle and smashing it down firmly into a flat, thin disk, you greatly increase the contact points between the meat and the griddle, which in turn increases the Maillard reaction. <br>
     That's the series of chemical reactions that create the rich brown crust that makes our steaks and burgers taste so freaking good.</p>

    <h2>Iingredients</h2>
    <p>folloiwng Iingredients are required to make fancy cheeese burger</p>

    <ul>
        <li> 1 pound very lean ground beef, or fresh ground sirloin</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li> 4 slices reduced-fat cheese</li>
        <li> 4 whole-wheat hamburger buns</li>
        <li> lettuce leaves, optional</li>
        <li> mustard, optional</li>
        <li> ketchup, optional</li>
        <li> barbecue sauce, optional</li>
        <li> canola cooking spray</li>
        <li> freshly ground pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        INSTRUCTIONS
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the beef into 4 equal portions. Use a patty press (or your hands) to make four burgers. Sprinkle them with the pepper and garlic salt.</li>
        <li>Pan-fry, broil, or grill the burgers, using canola cooking spray to keep them from sticking to the pan or grill. When the burgers are almost cooked through, place the cheese slices on top and finish cooking (30 to 60 seconds). Remove the burgers to the serving plate. If desired, cover the plate with foil to keep burgers warm and moist.</li>
        <li>Dress your burger on the bun with the lettuce, sliced tomato and onion, mustard, barbecue sauce, and ketchup as desired.</li>
        
    </ol>
